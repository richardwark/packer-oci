# Packer Workshop - Using Packer

![](images/WorkshopHeader/300.png)

## Introduction

In this lab we introduce the basics of packer. The goal will be to create your first image and log into an instance of that image.

To do this, you will first need packer installed on your laptop.  Packer can then use "providers" to build images in various cloud (OCI, AWS, Abibaba) and virtualization environments.
